            <h1><strong>My name is Joe and I am a sticky element</strong></h1>
            <p><strong>This is the story of me and how I got sticky!</strong></p>
            <p><strong>What happened to me.</strong></p>
            <h2>That fateful day!</h2>
            <p>As I said, my name is Joe and I am one of the elements. 
                You know, earth, wind, fire, water, and me Joe.
                I am not sure what kind of element I am, I'm not hot or cold, windy, or rainy. 
                I guess I'm Joey. Anyway, there had been a rumor going around that the elements,
                fire and water were dating in secret. I guess it's true because a few weeks ago
                they announced they were getting married! Fire had chosen me to be best man
                and therefore, I was in charge of the bachelor party. After some planning, 
                I finally found a place to hold it.It was a gentleelements club so you can imagine
                what kind of natural disaster might happen there. There were two exotic animal dancers
                named Sandy and Stormy and they promised a good time. It started out tame enough,
                but eventually things got a little wild. Honestly, the last thing I remember was
                doing ten counts on a keg of firewater.I must have passed out and somehow we must have
                made a roadtrip to disney world because when I woke up my face was in a giant jar of 
                honey and Winnie the Pooh was asleep on the floor. Needless to say, 
                I have been a sticky element ever since.Thank you for reading my story and if you would 
                like to help me get unsticky, please scroll up to the top, it should help!</p>
